/** central manager for all expressions.
 * 
 * Process parsers will use this to build expression objects that are stored in the
 * process definitions.
 * 
 * Then also this class is used as an entry point for runtime evaluation of the 
 * expressions.
 * 
 * This class is configurable in the ProcessEngineConfiguration.  So all methods and 
 * functionalities that are potentially customizable, are realized as overridable methods
 * in this class. 
 * 
 * Using this class, also the runtime engine doesn't create a hard dependency on the 
 * javax.el library as long as you don't use expressions.
