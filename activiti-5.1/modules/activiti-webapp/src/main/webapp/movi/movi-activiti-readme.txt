MOVI API

Details at:
http://bpt.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/Oryx/MOVI

They don't appear to have official versioned releases, so I've just built the project from source.

Built using:
"ant build"
on:
http://oryx-editor.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/poem-jvm/src/javascript/movi
(checked out using anon svn)

& copy contents of the generated build folder to this location.
