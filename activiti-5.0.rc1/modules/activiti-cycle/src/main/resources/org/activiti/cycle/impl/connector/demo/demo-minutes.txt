Meeting Minutes
---------------

Agenda:
1.) Scope and context of project
2.) Discuss high level process
3.) Define next steps


Project Scope
------------------
We want to re implement the incident management process, because currently it is pretty chaotic.


High Level Process
------------------
The high level (Level 1 according to the camunda method) was sketched and will be modeled in BPMN by Jakob afterwards
(see post: http://www.bpm-guide.de/2010/07/15/bpmn-2-0-am-beispiel-incident-management/).


Next Steps
------------------
The process will be modelled in Level 2 as well in BPMN (Jakob). This will be the input to discuss a possible
technical implementation.

Bottom line
------------------
We have talked for a while, was fun :-)
