package org.activiti;

/**
 * provides access to all the services that expose the BPM and workflow operations.
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <b>{@link org.activiti.ProcessService}: </b> Allows the creation of
 * {@link org.activiti.Deployment}s and the starting of and searching on
 * {@link org.activiti.ProcessInstance}s.</li>
 * <li>
 * <b>{@link org.activiti.TaskService}: </b> Exposes operations to manage human
 * (standalone) {@link org.activiti.Task}s, such as claiming, completing and
 * assigning tasks</li>
 * <li>
 * <b>{@link org.activiti.IdentityService}: </b> Used for managing
 * {@link org.activiti.identity.User}s, {@link org.activiti.identity.Group}s and
 * the relations between them<</li>
 * <li>
 * <b>{@link org.activiti.ManagementService}: </b> Exposes engine admin and
 * maintenance operations</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * Typically, there will be only one central ProcessEngine instance needed in a
 * end-user application. Building a ProcessEngine is done through a
 * {@link DbProcessEngineBuilder} instance and is a costly operation which should be
 * avoided. For that purpose, it is advised to store it in a static field or
 * JNDI location (or something similar). This is a thread-safe object, so no
 * special precautions need to be taken.
