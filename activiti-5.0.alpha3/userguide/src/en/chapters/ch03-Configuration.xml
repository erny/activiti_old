  <title>Configuration</title>

  <para>Activiti configuration files should be generated with the setup ant script.
  The <literal>cfg.create</literal> target can be easily configured 
  in the <literal>setup/build.properties</literal> and the <literal>setup/build.${db}.properties</literal>.
  Our QA runs only the configurations that are generatable by the setup script.
  We also do not guarantee compatbility of the actual configuration files in future versions
  as you will always be able to regenerate it.   So customizing the configuration files is 
  not recommended.
