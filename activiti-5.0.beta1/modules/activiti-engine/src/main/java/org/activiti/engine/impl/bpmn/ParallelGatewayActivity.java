/**
 * Implementation of the Parallel Gateway/AND gateway as definined in the BPMN
 * 2.0 specification.
 * 
 * The Parallel Gateway can be used for splitting a path of execution into
 * multiple paths of executions (AND-split/fork behavior), one for every
 * outgoing sequence flow.
 * 
 * The Parallel Gateway can also be used for merging or joining paths of
 * execution (AND-join). In this case, on every incoming sequence flow an
 * execution needs to arrive, before leaving the Parallel Gateway (and
 * potentially then doing the fork behavior in case of multiple outgoing
 * sequence flow).
 * 
 * Note that a Parallel Gateway having one incoming and multiple ougoing
 * sequence flow, is the same as having multiple outgoing sequence flow on a
 * given activity. However, a parallel gateway does NOT check conditions on the
 * outgoing sequence flow.
