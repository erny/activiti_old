    Public API of the Activiti engine.<br/><br/>
    Typical usage of the API starts by the creation of a {@link org.activiti.Configuration}
    (typically based on a configuration file), from which a {@link org.activiti.ProcessEngine} can be obtained.<br/><br/>
    Through the services obtained from such a {@link org.activiti.ProcessEngine}, BPM and workflow operation 
    can be executed:<br/><br/>
    
    <b>{@link org.activiti.ProcessService}: </b> Allows the creation of {@link org.activiti.Deployment}s and the 
    starting of and searching on {@link org.activiti.ProcessInstance}s <br/>
    
    <b>{@link org.activiti.TaskService}: </b> Exposes operations to manage human (standalone) {@link org.activiti.Task}s, 
    such as claiming, completing and assigning tasks<br/>

    <b>{@link org.activiti.IdentityService}: </b> Used for managing {@link org.activiti.identity.User}s, 
    {@link org.activiti.identity.Group}s and the relations between them<br/>
        
    <b>{@link org.activiti.ManagementService}: </b> Exposes engine admin and maintenance operations,
    which have no relation to the runtime exection of business processes<br/>
