  <title>API</title>

  <section id="apiEngine">
    <title>Engine API</title>
    <para>The engine API is the most common way of interacting with
    Activiti. The central starting point is the <literal>ProcessEngine</literal>,
    which can be created in several ways as described in the 
    <link linkend="configuration">configuration section</link>.
    From the ProcessEngine, you can obtain the
    various services that contain the workflow/BPM
    methods.  ProcessEngine and the services objects are thread safe.
    So you can keep a reference to 1 of those for a whole server.
    </para>
    <mediaobject><imageobject><imagedata align="center" fileref="images/api.services.png"/></imageobject></mediaobject>
    <programlisting>ProcessEngine processEngine = new ProcessEngineBuilder()
  .configureFromPropertiesResource(configurationResource)
  .buildProcessEngine();

RuntimeService runtimeService = processEngine.getRuntimeService();
RepositoryService repositoryService = processEngine.getRepositoryService();
TaskService taskService = processEngine.getTaskService();
ManagementService managementService = processEngine.getManagementService();
IdentityService identityService = processEngine.getIdentityService();
HistoryService historyService = processEngine.getHistoryService();
FormService formService = processEngine.getFormService();</programlisting>
    <para>The names of the service are quite self-explanatory.
    For detailed information on the services and the engine API, see<ulink url="../javadocs/index.html"> the javadocs</ulink>. 
    </para>
    
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Exception strategy</title>
    <para>The base exception in Activiti is the <literal>org.activiti.engine.ActivitiException</literal>, an unchecked exception. This exception can be thrown at all times by the API, but 'expected' exceptions that 
    happen in specific methods are documented in the <ulink url="../javadocs/index.html"> the javadocs</ulink>.
    For example, an extract from <literal>TaskService</literal>:
    <programlisting>/**
 * Called when the task is successfully executed.
 * @param taskId the id of the task to complete, cannot be null.
 * @throws ActivitiException when no task exists with the given id.
 */
 void complete(String taskId);
    </programlisting>
    
    In the example above, when an id is passed for which no task exists, an exception will be thrown. Also, since the javadoc <emphasis role="bold">explicitly states that taskId cannot be null, an <literal>ActivitiException</literal> will be thrown when <literal>null</literal> is passed</emphasis>.
    </para>
    <para>
      Even though we want to avoid a big exception hierarchy, the following subclasses were added which are thrown in specific cases:
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
            <para>
             <literal>ActivitiWrongDbException: </literal> Thrown when the Activiti engine discovers a mismatch between the database schema version and the engine version. 
            </para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>
             <literal>ActivitiOptimisticLockingException: </literal> Thrown when an optimistic locking occurs in the datastore caused by concurrent access of the same data entry. 
            </para>
          </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </para>
  </section>
  
  <section id="apiUnitTesting">
    <title>Unit testing</title>
    <para>
      Business processes are an integral part of software projects and they should be tested
      in the same way normal application logic is tested: with unit tests. Since Activiti
      is an embeddable Java engine, writing unit test for business processes is as simple
      as writing regular unit tests.
    </para>
    <para>
      Activiti supports both Junit versions 3 and 4 style of unit testing. In the Junit 3 style,
      the <emphasis>org.activiti.engine.test.ActivitiTestCase</emphasis> must be extended.
      This will make the processEngine and the services available through protected member fields. 
      In the <emphasis>setup()</emphasis> of the test,  the processEngine will be initialized
      by default with the <emphasis>activiti.cfg.xml</emphasis> resource on the classpath.  To specify a different
      configuration file, override the <emphasis>getConfigurationResource()</emphasis> method.
      Process engines are be cached statically over multiple unit tests when the configuration resource
      is the same. 
   </para>
   <para>
    By extending <emphasis>ActivitiTestCase</emphasis>, you can annotate test methods 
    with <emphasis>org.activiti.engine.test.Deployment</emphasis>. Before the test is run,
    a resource file of the form <emphasis>testClassName.testMethod.bpmn20.xml</emphasis>
    in the same package as the test class, will be deployed. At the end of the test, the deployment
    will be deleted, including all related process instances, tasks, etc. The <emphasis>Deployment</emphasis>
    annotation also supports setting the resource location explicitly. See 
    <ulink url="../javadocs/org/activiti/engine/test/Deployment.html">the Javadocs</ulink> for more
    details.
   </para> 
   <para>
     Taking all that in account, a Junit 3 style test looks as follows.
     <programlisting>
public class MyBusinessProcessTest extends ActivitiTestCase {
   
  @Deployment
  public void testSimpleProcess() {
    runtimeService.startProcessInstanceByKey(&quot;simpleProcess&quot;);
    
    Task task = taskService.createTaskQuery().singleResult();
    assertEquals(&quot;My Task&quot;, task.getName());
    
    taskService.complete(task.getId());
    assertEquals(0, runtimeService.createProcessInstanceQuery().count());
  }
}      
      </programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
      To get the same functionality when using the Junit 4 style of writing unit tests, 
      the <emphasis>org.activiti.engine.test.ActivitiRule</emphasis> Rule must be 
      used. Through this rule, the process engine and services are available through getters. As with the 
      <emphasis>ActivitiTestCase</emphasis> (see above), including this Rule will enable the use
      of the <emphasis>org.activiti.engine.test.Deployment</emphasis> annotation (see above for an explanation
      of its use and configuration) and it will look for the default configuration file on the classpath. 
      Process engines are statically cached over multiple unit tests when using the same configuration resource. 
   </para>
   <para>
     Following code snippet shows an example of using the Junit 4 style of testing and the 
     usage of the <emphasis>ActivitiRule</emphasis>. 
     <programlisting>
public class MyBusinessProcessTest {
  
  @Rule
  public ActivitiRule activitiRule = new ActivitiRule();
  
  @Test
  @Deployment
  public void ruleUsageExample() {
    RuntimeService runtimeService = activitiRule.getRuntimeService();
    runtimeService.startProcessInstanceByKey(&quot;ruleUsage&quot;);
    
    TaskService taskService = activitiRule.getTaskService();
    Task task = taskService.createTaskQuery().singleResult();
    assertEquals(&quot;My Task&quot;, task.getName());
    
    taskService.complete(task.getId());
    assertEquals(0, runtimeService.createProcessInstanceQuery().count());
  }
}
      </programlisting>
    </para>    
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>The process engine in a webapplication</title>
    
    <para>
      The <literal>ProcessEngine</literal> is a thread-safe class and can
      easily be shared among multiple threads. In a webapplication, this 
      means it is possible to create the process engine when the container boots
      and shut down the engine when the container goes down.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      The following code snippet how this is done in a regular Servlet environment,
      using a ServletContextListener:
      <programlisting>
public class ProcessEnginesServletContextListener implements ServletContextListener {
  
  public void contextInitialized(ServletContextEvent servletContextEvent) {
    ProcessEngines.init();
  }

  public void contextDestroyed(ServletContextEvent servletContextEvent) {
    ProcessEngines.destroy();
  }

}</programlisting>
      The contextInitialized will delegate to <literal>ProcessEngines.init()</literal>. That will
      look for <literal>activiti.cfg.xml</literal> resource files on the classpath,
      and create a <literal>ProcessEngines</literal> for the given configurations (eg. multiple jars with a configuration file).
      If you have multiple such resource files on the classpath, make sure they all have different names.
      When the process engine  is needed, it can be fetched using <programlisting>ProcessEngines.getDefaultProcessEngine()</programlisting>
      or <programlisting>ProcessEngines.getProcessEngine("myName");</programlisting>
      Of course, it is also possible to use any of the variants of creating a process engine, 
      as described in the <link linkend="configuration">configuration section</link>.
    </para>
    
    <para>The contextDestroyed of the context-listener delegates to <literal>ProcessEngines.destroy()</literal>.
    That will properly close all initialized process engines.
    </para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Process Virtual Machine API</title>
    <para><link linkend="experimental"><emphasis role="bold">[EXPERIMENTAL]</emphasis></link>
    This API is probably going to change in subsequent releases.
    </para>
    <para>The Process Virtual Machine API exposes the POJO core of the Process Virtual Machine.
    Reading and playing with it is interesting for education purposes to understand
    the internal workings of Activiti.  And the POJO API can also be used to build
    new process languages.
    </para>
    <para>For example:</para>
    <programlisting>PvmProcessDefinition processDefinition = new ProcessDefinitionBuilder()
  .createActivity("a")
    .initial()
    .behavior(new WaitState())
    .transition("b")
  .endActivity()
  .createActivity("b")
    .behavior(new WaitState())
    .transition("c")
  .endActivity()
  .createActivity("c")
    .behavior(new WaitState())
  .endActivity()
  .buildProcessDefinition();

PvmProcessInstance processInstance = processDefinition.createProcessInstance();
processInstance.start();

PvmExecution activityInstance = processInstance.findExecution("a");
assertNotNull(activityInstance);

activityInstance.signal(null, null);

activityInstance = processInstance.findExecution("b");
assertNotNull(activityInstance);

activityInstance.signal(null, null);

activityInstance = processInstance.findExecution("c");
assertNotNull(activityInstance);</programlisting>
  </section>
  
  
  <section id="apiExpressions">
    <title>Expressions</title>
    <para>Activiti uses UEL for expression-resolving. UEL stands for <emphasis>Unified Expression Language</emphasis> and is part of the EE6 specification ()see
          <ulink url="http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/820-7627/gjddd?l=en&amp;a=view">
          the EE6 specification</ulink> for detailed information). To support all features of latest UEL spec on ALL environements, we use a modified version of JUEL.
    </para>
    <para>
      Expressions can be used in for example <link linkend="bpmnJavaServiceTaskXML">Java Service tasks</link>, <link linkend="executionListeners">Execution Listeners</link>, <link linkend="taskListeners">Task Listeners</link> and  <link linkend="conditionalSequenceFlowXml">Conditional sequence flows</link>.
      Although there are 2 types of expressions, value-expression and method-expression, activiti makes abstraction of this and they can both be used where an <literal>expression</literal> is needed.
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            <emphasis role="bold">Value expression</emphasis>: resolves to a value. By default, all process variables are available to use. Also all spring-beans (if using Spring) are available to use in expressions. 
            On top of that, the <literal>DelegateExecution</literal> is also available in the expression-context and can be accessed using the name <literal>execution</literal>. 
            <emphasis role="bold">Since the execution is exposed as <literal>execution</literal>, all variables and spring-beans with name <literal>execution</literal> are hidden and cannot be used in an expression.</emphasis>
            Some examples:
<programlisting>${myVar}
${myBean.myProperty}</programlisting>
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
        <para>
            <emphasis role="bold">Method expression</emphasis>: invokes a method, with or without parameters. <emphasis role="bold">When invoking a method without parameters, be sure to add empty parentheses after the method-name.</emphasis>
            The passed parameters can be literal values or expressions that are resolved themselves. Examples:
<programlisting>${printer.print()}
${myBean.addNewOrder('orderName')}
${myBean.doSomething(myVar, execution)}
</programlisting>
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      Note that these expressions support resolving primitives (incl. comparing them), beans, lists, arrays and maps.
    </para>
