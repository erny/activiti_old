Activiti Fork
=============

[Activiti](http://activiti.org) is a BPM Workflow engine sponsored by Alfresco
and contributed by the community.

This is a temporary fork of Activiti 5.7 (svn rev 2941) and later.
It's used for adding some new features we need mainly in the REST interface.

It has been created with the excellent svn2git tool:

        $ mkdir activiti; cd activiti
        $ svn2git https://svn.codehaus.org/activiti/activiti -m --revision 2941 

Please note that branches and tags with commits before rev 2941 are not
included.

The "master" branch will always contain the original Activiti sources. Please
see the log to know the last update.

Any yaco branches will reflect new features. Yaco tags will be added to 
make stable releases.

If you have any questions, drop me a mail.
